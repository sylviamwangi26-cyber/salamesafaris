  <h1>Stories from the Soul of Kenya</h1>
  <p class="blog-intro">
    Kenya is not just a destination.  
    It is a feeling. A rhythm. A story waiting to be lived.
  </p>

  <!-- ===== STORY 1 ===== -->
  <article class="blog-post">
    <img src="pictures/blog/kenya.jpg" alt="Kenya Landscape">

    <h2>Kenya: Who We Are, What We Are, Why You Come</h2>
    <p>
      Kenya is a land where the earth still remembers the footsteps of its ancestors.
      From snow-capped mountains to endless savannahs, from coral reefs to red deserts,
      Kenya holds many worlds in one heartbeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      People come to Kenya searching for wildlife, but they leave with something deeper:
      connection, humility, and a renewed sense of wonder.
      Here, time slows down — and life feels real again.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== STORY 2 ===== -->
  <article class="blog-post">
    <img src="pictures/blog/maasai-mara.jpg" alt="Maasai Mara">

    <h2>Maasai Mara: Myths, Misconceptions & Untold Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Many believe the Maasai Mara is only about the Great Migration.
      But the Mara is more than a seasonal spectacle.
      It is sacred land — alive with stories whispered by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the postcards lie hidden valleys, ancient Maasai traditions,
      and moments of silence so powerful they change you.
      The Mara is not crowded chaos — it is quiet magic, if you know where to look.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- ===== STORY 3 ===== -->
  <article class="blog-post">
    <img src="pictures/blog/hells-kitchen.jpg" alt="Hell’s Kitchen Kenya">

    <h2>Hell’s Kitchen: A Story of Fire, Love & Loss</h2>
    <p>
      Locals say Hell’s Kitchen was once a place of great love.
      When betrayal shattered that love, the earth itself cracked open,
      releasing fire, steam, and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the canyon glows red at sunset —
      not with anger, but remembrance.
      It is a place that reminds us:
      even pain becomes beauty with time.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- ===== STORY 4 ===== -->
  <article class="blog-post">
    <img src="pictures/blog/watamu.jpg" alt="Watamu Beach">

    <h2>5 Places to Visit in Watamu — And Why They Stay With You</h2>
    <p>
      Watamu is where the ocean whispers instead of shouting.
      Visit the Marine Park to swim with turtles,
      the Arabuko Sokoke Forest to hear ancient birds,
      and the ruins of Gede to feel history breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come for the beaches.
      Stay for the peace.
      Leave knowing you touched something pure.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- ===== STORY 5 ===== -->
  <article class="blog-post">
    <img src="pictures/blog/salame.jpg" alt="Salame Safari Tours">

    <h2>Salame Safari Tours: Kenya Through the Eyes of a Friend</h2>
    <p>
      people understand beauty.
      They understand emotion.
      They understand living slowly and deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Salame Safari Tours, we don’t sell safaris.
      We open doors.
      We guide you as family, not customers.
      Kenya with us is not a trip —
      it is a homecoming.
