    ABOUT US:
     Your Companions in the Wild Heart of Africa
    Kenya is more than just our workplace—it is our home, our heart, and our heritage.
    At Salame Safari Tours, we believe a safari shouldn't just be a checklist of animals to see;
    it should be a moment where time stands still.

    We were born from a simple dream:
    to share the raw, untouched beauty of our "backyard" with the world.
    When you travel with us, you aren't just a booking. You are a guest of our land.

    From the golden dust of Amboseli to the legendary plains of the Mara,
    we take you deep into the savannah, sharing stories and revealing secret corners known only to those who live here.
    We are a small, passionate team dedicated to showing you the Kenya we love:
    the one that gets under your skin and stays in your soul forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why Choose Salame?

    Deep Roots: Our guides are part of our family.
    They don't just find wildlife; they interpret the rhythm of the land.

    Travel with Purpose: We protect what we love.
    Every safari supports local communities and the wild spaces that make Kenya a magical place.

    Our Mottos
